# C++ Course 2020 Highlights

This repository contains the highlights of the 9-month C++ course 2020. I worked together with different teammates
during the three parts, but I only include exercises here that I solved myself, notably without AI assistance (insert
rant about "The good old days" here). The course was held at the University of Groningen.
