Running the program with "time ./main 3000 1" yields the
following output:

SHELL=/bin/bash
_=./main

real    0m2,200s
user    0m2,191s
sys     0m0,008s

We rerun with "time ./main 3000 0" and get:

SHELL=/bin/bash
_=./main

real    0m1,502s
user    0m1,501s
sys     0m0,000s

This shows that moving the std::string data is a lot 
faster than copying.
