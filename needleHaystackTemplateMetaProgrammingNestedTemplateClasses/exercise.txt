- learn to compare types of template parameters

- template meta class 'Type' should receive a 'Needle' and 
  several 'Haystack' (param pack) and generate ::located, the
  index at which the Needle could be found in the rest of the 
  args, else 0

- We went for an approach with one template meta class, assuming
  the hint with TypeIdx is a hint, not a requirement. The Type
  class just calls its own specializations to assign the correct 
  value to ::located in its enum.
