- learn to compare types of template parameters (part 2)


- same exercise as 20 but extra requirements:
  - the support class TypeIdx must be a private, 
    nested class (it may be a struct) of the class Type.
  - the interface of the class Type may only contain the 
    declaration of the support class TypeIdx.
